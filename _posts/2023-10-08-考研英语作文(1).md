Dear Mr. Wang,
I am very delighted to recall the past two months when I worked as an editor for your magazine. However, I am writing for the purpose of quiting since this work is not what I expected.
	It was your and other colleagues' tremendous help that enabled me to accumulate certain ability and experience. Thus I am quite grateful to you for your help. Anyway,my competence, compared with the demands of this job, is not adequate and I cannot do it well. In addition, I am keen on computer science rather than editing. To  conclude, it is not advisable for me to continue this work. 
	Finally, I truly hope that you can stand in my shoes and accept my apologies.
	                                                                      Yours sincerely,
